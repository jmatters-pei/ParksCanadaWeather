DATA CLEANING OPERATIONS
1. Column Name Standardization
Operations Applied:

Split column names at parentheses or underscores, keep first part

Convert to title case

Apply standard replacements

Standard Replacements:

Original Name(s)	Standardized To
wind gust speed, wind gust speed, gust speed	Wind Gust Speed
avg wind speed, average wind speed, wind spd, windspd	Wind Speed
accumulated rain, precip. amount	Rain
temp	Temperature
wind dir	Wind Direction
rel hum	Rh
date/time	Date/Time
contains 'dew'	Dew
Example:

Temperature (°C) → Temperature

Wind_Speed_mph → Wind

Relative Humidity → Rh

Code Location: Lines 251-296 (clean_columns function)

2. Column Removal
Columns Dropped:

Columns containing "serial" (any case)

Columns containing "battery" (any case)

Duplicate column names (keeps first occurrence)

Constant columns (0 or 1 unique values, except 'station')

Example Removals:

Serial_Number

Battery_Voltage

Status (if all values are the same)

Code Location: Lines 263-294

3. Duplicate Column Merging
Operation:

When multiple columns have the same name (after standardization)

Uses backward fill across columns to merge values

Keeps first column, drops duplicates

Example:

text
Temperature (from sensor A): [20, NaN, 22]
Temperature (from sensor B): [NaN, 21, NaN]
Merged Temperature:          [20, 21, 22]
Code Location: Lines 588-608 (merge_duplicate_columns)

4. Datetime Processing
Operations Applied:

ECCC Date/Time Column:

Parse to UTC timezone

Rename to Datetime_UTC

Drop original Date/Time column

Separate Date and Time Columns:

Combine into single datetime: date + ' ' + time

Parse to UTC timezone

Drop original separate columns

Standardization:

All datetime columns converted to UTC

Unparseable values set to NaT (Not a Time)

Data sorted by datetime

Code Location: Lines 609-645 (process_datetime_columns)

5. Data Type Conversions
Operations:

All numeric columns converted from object/string to numeric

Non-numeric values coerced to NaN

Datetime columns converted to pandas datetime64

Example:

"23.5" (string) → 23.5 (float)

"N/A" (string) → NaN (missing)

Code Location: Lines 746-752

6. Duplicate Row Handling
Detection:

Duplicate rows identified and counted

Logged in data quality reports

Current Behavior:

Duplicates are logged but NOT removed

Allows manual review of duplicate patterns

Code Location: Lines 396-398

7. Empty Row Removal
Removed:

Rows where ALL data columns are NaN

Keeps rows with at least one valid measurement

Example:

text
Row 1: Datetime=2022-01-01, Temp=NaN, RH=NaN, Wind=NaN  → REMOVED
Row 2: Datetime=2022-01-01, Temp=20, RH=NaN, Wind=NaN   → KEPT
Code Location: Lines 678-681

8. Character Encoding Fixes
Applied During File Loading:

Primary: UTF-8 encoding

Fallback: Latin1 encoding (if UTF-8 fails)

Skip: Bad lines that can't be parsed

Handles:

Special characters (°, ñ, é, etc.)

Different file encodings from various sources

Code Location: Lines 141-155

MISSING DATA IMPUTATION
Imputation Strategy Overview
Two-Tier Approach:

Tier 1: Linear interpolation (smallest assumption)

Tier 2: Variable-specific rules (domain knowledge)

Threshold Rule:

If >25% missing for a station-variable → SKIP IMPUTATION

Rationale: Likely sensor failure, too uncertain to impute

TIER 1: Linear Interpolation
Method: Time-based linear interpolation

Parameters:

Maximum gap: 2 hours

Direction: Both forward and backward

Method: Linear based on time distance

Formula:

text
y = y₁ + (y₂ - y₁) × (t - t₁) / (t₂ - t₁)
Applied To: ALL numeric variables

Example:

text
Time:  10:00  11:00  12:00  13:00  14:00
Temp:   20     ?      ?      23     24

Imputed:
11:00 = 20 + (23-20) × 1/3 = 21.0°C
12:00 = 20 + (23-20) × 2/3 = 22.0°C
Imputation Flag: 1 (interpolated)

Code Location: Lines 842-867

TIER 2: Variable-Specific Rules
Rain Imputation
Rule: Missing rain = 0 mm

Rationale:

Rain gauges often record 0 as missing/blank

Absence of rain recording = no rain occurred

Conservative assumption for fire risk

Example:

text
Rain: [2.5, NaN, NaN, 1.2, NaN, 3.0]
→     [2.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 0.0, 3.0]
Imputation Flag: 2 (calculated)

Code Location: Lines 896-902

Wind Gust Speed Imputation
Rule: If gust missing but wind speed available → Use wind speed

Rationale:

Gust speed ≥ average wind speed (by definition)

Using average wind speed is conservative estimate

Better than leaving blank

Example:

text
Wind Speed:      [15, 18, 20, 12]
Wind Gust Speed: [25, ?, 30, ?]
→                [25, 18, 30, 12]
Imputation Flag: 2 (calculated)

Code Location: Lines 905-913

Relative Humidity (Rh) Calculation
Rule: Calculate from Temperature and Dew Point using Magnus formula

Formula:

text
e_dew = exp((17.625 × Dew) / (243.04 + Dew))
e_temp = exp((17.625 × Temp) / (243.04 + Temp))
Rh = 100 × (e_dew / e_temp)
Rh = clip(Rh, 0, 100)
Constants:

a = 17.625 (Magnus constant)

b = 243.04°C (Magnus constant)

Applied When:

Rh is missing

Temperature is available

Dew Point is available

Example:

text
Temperature: 20°C
Dew Point:   15°C
→ Calculated Rh: ~73.4%
Imputation Flag: 2 (calculated)

Code Location: Lines 700-727, 916-926

Imputation Flags
Every imputed column gets a corresponding flag column:

Flag Value	Meaning	Method
0	Original data	No imputation
1	Interpolated	Linear interpolation (Tier 1)
2	Calculated	Variable-specific rule (Tier 2)
Flag Column Names:

Data column: Temperature

Flag column: Temperature_imputed

Example DataFrame:

text
Datetime_UTC         Temperature  Temperature_imputed
2022-01-01 10:00:00      20.5            0  (original)
2022-01-01 11:00:00      21.2            1  (interpolated)
2022-01-01 12:00:00       0.0            2  (calculated: Rain)
DATA AGGREGATION METHODS
Hourly Aggregation
Time Window: ±30 minutes around each hour

Example:

For 14:00 hour: Include data from 13:30 to 14:30

Aggregation by Variable Type:

Variable Type	Method	Examples
Average values	Mean	Temperature, Dew Point, Rh, Wind Speed
Maximum values	Max	Wind Gust Speed
Totals	Sum	Rain (precipitation)
Directional	Circular Mean	Wind Direction
Circular Mean for Wind Direction:

text
Formula:
1. Convert degrees to radians
2. Calculate mean of sine components: sin_mean
3. Calculate mean of cosine components: cos_mean
4. Angle = arctan2(sin_mean, cos_mean)
5. Convert back to degrees
Why Circular Mean:

Regular mean of 350° and 10° = 180° (wrong!)

Circular mean of 350° and 10° = 0° (correct!)

Output: One row per hour per station

Code Location: Lines 982-1044 (create_hourly_aggregates)

Daily Aggregation
Time Window: Entire day (00:00 to 23:59)

Aggregation by Variable Type:

Variable	Min	Max	Mean	Sum	Other
Temperature	✓	✓	✓		
Dew Point	✓	✓	✓		
Rh (Humidity)	✓	✓	✓		
Wind Speed		✓	✓		
Wind Gust Speed		✓			
Rain				✓	
Wind Direction					Most common
Output Columns:

Temperature_min, Temperature_max, Temperature_mean

Rain_total (sum of all precipitation)

Wind_Direction_mode (most frequent direction)

Output: One row per day per station

Code Location: Lines 1046-1087 (create_daily_aggregates)

DATA VALIDATION & BOUNDS
Temperature Bounds
Valid Range: -40°C to +40°C

Rationale:

Historical PEI climate extremes

Values outside range likely sensor errors

Action:

Values < -40°C → Set to NaN

Values > +40°C → Set to NaN

Code Location: Lines 929-932

Relative Humidity Bounds
Valid Range: 0% to 100%

Rationale:

Physical limits of relative humidity

0% = completely dry air

100% = saturated air

Action:

Values clipped to [0, 100]

Negative values → 0%

Values > 100% → 100%

Code Location: Lines 935-938

Dew Point Bounds
Valid Range: -50°C to +50°C

Rationale:

Catches sensor and imputation errors

Action:

Values outside range → Set to NaN

Code Location: Lines 45-46 (CONFIG)

Physical Relationship Validation
Dew Point ≤ Temperature

Check: Dew point should never exceed air temperature

Action: (Not currently implemented, future enhancement)

Flag or correct violations

Dew > Temp indicates sensor error
